0, i bought this hoping to use as intended angled into guitar & straight into mixer wrong have to use it the other way around  sad overall,  awful,1
1, don't buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand it is barely workable for twoit is easy to set up but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place and you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floorgroundthe best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back for les paul and strat type axes their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow stick like feet of the stand especially when they are new you can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand if you just gotta buy something from on stage get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced but really you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for overall, a complete joke ,1
2, this product is bad quality because the noise it makes it increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all i'm going to sell this product i didn't like it overall, a lot a noise when using rate different from 50 ,1
3, these types of pedals are toys they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with by all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing if not i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay or distortion overall, a toy ,1
4, i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac33 acoustic amp  the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy  however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate  this is totally unnecessary for a footswitch  the worst part is the leads on the battery connector 9 volt were not properly soldered or had shorted out  the only way i could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made  for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed ie all that has to work are two switches and a battery you would think that boss would put out a better product  i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question  i would highly recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site overall, absolute junk ,1
5, well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks  bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago  last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar messed around a bit and it started to work  today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp  thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy  got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either  at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a 12 cord maybe i'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i'd return it  not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund  will just move on to another company's cord overall, after 8 weeks the cable quit working ,1
6, garbage if you like it then buy it this is not how the world of music sounds too much bass and other garbage are you guys really hearing anything ?world has gone bass crazy since about 1981more and more we lost analog we lost quality thanks to compression and mp3 and now to put more crap into our ears they give you onefrequencybass only  take it or leave it will go find real headphones thanks overall, almost zero stars bass crazy world ,1
7, i got a couple of these only buy this cable if there is no chance that it will be ever used in the real world after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug and of course  since this cord is molded sealed up tight  it can't be repaired you could cut off the plug and solder a good 14 inch plug on it but why bother? Just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord this cord is too flimsy its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing but inside its junk thrown away money buy a lottery scratch off instead overall, avoid avoid ,1
8, i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting  this one is the worst  the plastic screw yes plastic that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle  bad just bad secondly there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp  it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement  after twisting on it twice i stripped it out  now the thing is worthless  i'm returning it asapi would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing  do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6 pop filter  if you don't you'll wish you did overall, avoid this one like your motherinlaw ,1
9, i have three mic stands with this one being the fourth i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible1 the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down2 the bottom clamp never did secure properly it kept opening up even without a mic on it the weight of the stand itself stripped iti sent it back without hesitation overall, awful ,1
10, i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys however you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an xlr cable testeri didn't believe it myself read another reviewer had an issue with xlr cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cablesi got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was miss wired now i will be checking all of them for sure not a good start though glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it oni suggest everyone check their monorpice cables the testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren't aware of overall, be careful with these ,1
11, here's the deal with this pedal it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money in my opinion for spending less than 100 for a distortion pedal whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it overall, beginners beware ,1
12, the cables are great for the price cant go wrong i have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables don't buy this cables they keep failing cheap material with what i spent on them you could buy a couple decent ones overall, best deal cheap cables ,1
13, i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar my first cheap cord wasn't actually broken but i didn't want any down time so i had this just sitting there as a replacement fast forward some time and i just wanted to try it out even though my cheap cord was still working fine i really wanted to just try out the new cordi really wish i had done that in the first 30 days this cord did not work right at all it seems like there is a short in it somewhere i had to unplug plug maneuver into place of course since it is for guitar it falls almost immediately out of place again so i am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed unlike this brand new bad cable overall, broke almost immediately,1
14, there is a problem with the design  when you move the head the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head just break off  the tuner itself is great but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes overall, broke ,1
15, i ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap the first one arrived in non working condition wires inside weren't even soldered so i ordered a replacement plugged it in and it didn't work either the second wasn't soldered either know its cheap but i expected it to at least work do not buy overall, broke ,1
16, like the other one star reviewers  my problem is that the head broke off i tried to glue it back on but it just fell apart even worse when i tried to do that if you buy this you really need to baby it my advice is look for a more sturdy model overall, broken head ,1
17, go build your own build it to your specs and have a solid stand if not you can find a lot better head stands this one was a huge disappointment does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick im back with my wood block and am happy overall,  awful,1
18, i wanted to like this i really did the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think &34;perfect&34; however the unit i received was cr@p and i'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions the one i got kept cutting in and out you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75 of the notes or something and when holding a chord the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds frustrating did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit the soso sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go bummer any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability? Cheers overall, bummer ,1
19, not very bright not very flexible too big clunky i really don't like it i wish i had went in a different direction overall, bummer ,1
20, doano good out of the boxplug it nothingno way to send it back i`m not from the statesmeaningi just wasted away 40 something bucks add shippingi did bought a behringer pedal before tremolopan with good results but i guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedalswell i`ll man up and buy something else overall, busted ,1
21, well it's not really too expensive but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it  even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for  guess that's why it's so cheap overall, can't dunlop come up with a better descriptive word then b***** ? ,1
22, the small estring and the g string both broke on the ball end while tuning  i haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years never ever had one break on the ball endluckily i bought the three packbut i can't recommend this product overall, can't recommend this product ,1
23, this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside  upon receiving mine and assembling it it broke immediately while i was trying to mount an ipad onto it  it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability  the metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle overall, very disappointed in built quality ,1
24, ok its cheap you knew that when you bought it i really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture it was only one and it was red broke with first use overall, cheap cheap ,1
25, second one i bought lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months went through two of these before i learned my lesson don't waste your money on this junk i love planet waves stuff normally but these are junk overall, cheap piece of crap ,1
26, just use a smartphone to record stuff this is a really weird not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones not really worth the 75  i returned mine overall,  awful,1
27, unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes overall, useless for drop tuning ,1
28, disappointing; was looking for to receiving thesebut; mostly they are unplayable leak air badly easier learning bagpipes than these thingssave your money and get some harps that actually workdecent case though overall, useless ,1
29, the cable died on me in less than a month very disappointed in built quality overall, very disappointed in built quality ,1
30, only lasted 2yr  i have a lot of cheaper cables that get more useabuse than this one that have outlasted it overall, very disappointed ,1
31, i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr55 which has a flawless basic looper built in but only 20 seconds record and no undo i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn't need to carry a power adapter alongthe factory battery lasted about 1 hour the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes i started recording a loop with another 3rd fresh battery tested 910 v with a multimeter and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording suggesting that it was faulty the lights started coming on and off randomly recordundoall three together then off then undo on then all three on etc etcthe first time i used the jamman xt with the factory battery it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it suckedi am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything so i know it was not my poor technique the main problem was that it didn't matter how hard i tried even if i did a manual fade out there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start this makes the unit uselessalso it is poorly conceived in that to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws exposing the delicate printed circuit boardthe potential for damage here is very high also replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible read inevitable damagei have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this oneit's going back to the store where i purchased it overall, very disappointed in built quality ,1
32, often we get what we pay for after researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks i chose solid items for reasonable pricesi should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle  the quality of the cable this item simply didn't ever work  it arrived with a bent pen on one end and even when we attempted to straighten it it didn't connect well onto the mixer board the microphone end was a very shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the micdon't buy this item  spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand overall, very poor quality pins were bent ,1
33, i had some issues with my 18watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes  issues not only continued but worsened  hum noise volume fade unwanted distortion at low volumes  i eventually put back the original el84s and that didn't help  once i removed the tungsol 12ax7 preamp tubes and replaced the hum stopped sound quality of the amp was consistent quiet and back to par  my experience with the tungsol tubes was very very negative  they caused me to go out and buy another amp  i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast  i'll never buy this brand again overall, very unhappy with the performance and quality ,1
34, based upon some of the other reviews i feel i got a different product as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others i ordered two of these and both were very thin material not sturdy at all second both straps were not adjustable to 59&34; both mine measured 45&34; from strap button hole to strap button hole fullyextended they are useless to me as my guitar a dreadnought covers the middle of my chest when i put it on i believe i was given a substitute product since when i ordered these straps the price was just 100 and now they're back up to 495 as i write this i'm really sick of these amazon substitutions for what i paid i won't bother returning themnot worth the hassle i will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars very disappointed warningif you see a price drop below 495 don't buyit's probably not the product that's described here overall, very very disappointed ,1
35, these picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar i don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups etc big disappointment i'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem back to the drawing board i go overall,  awful,1
36, bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat doesn't fit perfect kinda bummed but oh well overall,  awful,1
37, this piece of plastic is just terrible  you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towelnot recommended overall, waste of money ,1
38, the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes i dont like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time i used it the cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and i lost sound this cable is complete garbage never again overall, waste of money ,1
39, this unit might be great if you have child hands  the keys on the  keyboard is soooo small  don't get this if you have man hands wtf u[date the description akai wtf overall, what a joke ,1
40, i have always loved line 6 this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up it went dead i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead i am sorry to say that i returned it my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outsi am really disappointed overall,  awful,1
41, amazon and tc electronics will not tell you that you need a 9v power supply i didn't see any warning or advise in the point of purchase nor in the package this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics overall,  awful,1
42, these speakers worked great for 14 months last week 4813 one of them wouldn't power up all the way the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them and it's just a matter of time before it stops working  it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews i took a chance on the monitors anyway and it was a huge mistake i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week i contacted maudio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops one on the east coast and one on be west coast i've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the maudio support site maudio doesn't stand behind their products and i'll never purchase anything from them again overall, worked great for 14 months ,1
43, very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it  the little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless  i will try to get a replacement now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need overall, works great if it doesn't break ,1
44, i know many people love the design but i find it much too frustrating you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly then snap it in then turn and turn the screw oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again what a farce this is the worst capo i've owned and i've tried nearly every brand and type yeah i've had people show me how to do it right and i know to do it right it's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on snapping it screwing it in screwing it off having it fall off forget it it's garbage to me also while i'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw it's actually slightly painful to the fingers momentarily but why have to deal with that?? to work with this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it the only good thing i can say about it is looks durableno thanks overall, worst capo i've ever used ,1
45, i own the sn8 which btw is the best tuner i've ever used i bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin i was also intrigued by the &34;tighter&34; tuning aspect of the bars on this let me tell you if it worked the bars may have been a cool feature but when you are finetuning an a string and it tells you you are on e when you know you are on a bc the other tuners all say a and it matches the piano then there is a problem i could not find any way to recalibrate the thing so it looks like it's just defective the one i received was completely uselessi am amazed at the great sn8i am disappointed in this thing i must have just received a dud i hope since these usually get good reviews but i will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly on the flip side i will be getting another sn8 in it's place since i know those are great tuners & i love the one i already have overall, worst tuner i've ever used ,1
46, there are better tuners out there far better this could be good but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there and they don't even tune it well to standard especially when tuning the g string i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing but sometimes i want to fiddle around with opentunings on an acoustic this pieceofjunk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using f or c notes i have no clue as to why that is pretty stupid if you ask me especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic dbags i say that with love that play in open tunings trust me your money is best spent elsewhere overall,  yuck,1
47, this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima not the product these people posted what seemed like a good price not ridiculously low on the us dream pedal it was to be shipped from japan they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order this kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on amazoncom because the item was less than 400 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers yorozuya yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident overall,  awful,1
48, wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless the screen came out was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is much betteravoid this overall, yuck ,1
49, i really wanted to like these but they're a frickin lintcatching sticky frickin' mess they went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a new york minute have never seen the light of day and may have been thrown in the garbage save your money we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now overall, yuk ,1
50, purchased these for a new heritage h575 arch top  a few months later the high e string unwound from the ball end  overall good strings good sound  this set simply didn't last very long  i will replace with 12s however  for me the 11s felt a little loose  the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box  i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model  i'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s overall, broke two days after use ,2
51, header says it all works well enough as a string winder but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me this did not work well at all went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle overall, as a string winder ok as a pin remover not so good ,2
52, well its a stand  its super cheap and i don't mean the price  the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back  its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well  instructions were ok  came with more parts than what were required all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra the guitars do not sit very well in this stand i will use it until i can find a better one it will get replaced i really should send this pos back to amazon  the concept is great but the execution of it sucks it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand  there are better options out there for something portable  this stand is worth 1000 tops if i had it to do all over i would save my money overall, as cheap as the come ,2
53, as the title states this is a lightly padded duffle bag nothing more if you're toating between practice with an instructor it's okay i purchased it for that reasonand i'm an adult so i can be careful this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag it will prevent my guitar from scuffs dings dent & dirt but that's itthere are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price overall, bare minimum ,2
54, i'd give this 1 and a half stars if i could this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touchmove a cable plugged into it it is so hard to get full sound in headearphones with this i can only hear in one ear in every headphoneoutput and hardly anything in the other i have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second i can still use this but hardly i really don't like this overall,  bleh,2
55, i honestly was not impressed it looked cheap sounded cheap what else is there to say you get what you pay for another chinese copy of a tubescreamer overall,  bleh,2
56, the version i picked came with a grounding wire claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostaticproducing snap crackles and pops  if you believe that continue to do so and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device  speaking more pragmatically i've found some use for the item only when loose conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc overall,  bleh,2
57, not happy with the sellers description or the product the description says heavy duty which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic mic clip but it's not it's rubber it sucks used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly and flex it's flexible who uses flexible mic clips? make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead overall, beware,2
58, in the old days we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear stringsnow tis almost impossiblewith these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetarone will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble stringsvery nice resonant and cleannot shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont knowagain like someone else noted the obvious>>>>>sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is giganticthis makes the move from the d to the g string too noticablecant they even make  6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ?makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totallysucks bad nowoohthanks man overall, bipolar gtr syndrome half nylon sound half  something else totally ,2
59, the tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo i've ever used  and i've tried many over the years but what was ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem including the pick clip and tuner holder protude outward away from the fingerboard? it's awkward to apply and remove quickly it's visually distracting for player and audience and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustmentthe only possible justification i can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck   but even that doesn't fly regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and unless you're avoiding playing that first fret or use a lowthumb classical fret hand position you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand i own the older planet waves triaction capo and never felt that to be a problemotherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb the surface is arched probably between a 1012 radius that works fine on various strat fingerboards as well as a flatter sglp style it doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my martin om1 which is virtually the same as a classical if i cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but i wouldn't risk marring the neck woodi tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional but to be honest i wouldn't use either  too distracting and i only use tuners to get an initial a then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments depending on what they arethe only other capo i've ever used that protudes outward is the kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design i have one and as good as the holding action is i've never felt comfortable with the design the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preferenceto top off the confusion the picture on the front of the cardboard card the ns artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo overall, bizarre variant of the older planet waves triaction capo ,2
60, a very boring dull uninspiring pedal don't waste your time with this a boss sd1 or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range overall, boring boring boring ,2
61, first time i tried to use it it broke in my hand  it is now taped together while i wait for a different kind to replace it overall, broke in my hand ,2
62, my first desk mic stand and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use it worked once when i originally set it then kaput it's never worked properly since i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height i would not purchase this product again overall, broke two days after use ,2
63, it is built like a tank but it quit working after a couple of weeks i haven't made time trouble shoot it yet so i'm not sure what component has failed overall, buolt well but stopped working ,2
64, the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings for steel strings i want more pressure i advise getting the ns capo that is not lite  i prefer that one above this model overall, broke two days after use ,2
65, this is a basic eq pedal that is a bit noisy in my testing even when running on battery power there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs overall, buzzy buz buzz ,2
66, in my experience these cables were not great  the connectors rattle they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise  i can't expect miracles at that pricepoint but i certainly expected better i avoid this brand of cables overall, cheap connections ,2
67, i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it upon close inspection the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe 025&34; wall so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off even if it is welded better than mine was just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs it is literally that thin of metal tubingfor 1011 i did not expect perfection so to it's credit it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitarsthis stand does have one other good quality it is cheap since it was less that 11 i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it i was able to carefully weld mine back together but this would probably not be an option for most the stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up but if you need portability and durability i would definitely purchase a better quality stand overall, cheaply made and not very durable ,2
68, it is not the size for mini guitar may be for the big oneconnections are shaky you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low overall, defective ,2
69, stopped working all by itself fresh battery didn't helpfortunately i've another plus a korg and an two intellitouch i've 2 fiddles and 3 guitarsthe intellitouch is simply champion overall, defective ,2
70, this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play withanyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise also the pedal just started oscillating a few times i would have given the behringer us600 five stars if it kept working it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad overall, cool pedal that broke quick ,2
71, i am a fan of planet waves ns capos but this new one is not very well designed the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards i find my left hand hitting the lever when i'm in open position frustrating it does have a pick holder which can be handy and a place to put an ns tuner which can also be handy i just think it could have been better designed i don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff i'll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser overall, cumbersome ,2
72, levy's leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material especially on the edges  it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt yukko  the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap overall, defective ,2
73, considering the price is so cheap on these i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio to say that i used it rarely is an understatement  maybe once a month when i have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges that said within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way upaside from it not working less than a year later as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well however if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice it's a decent little mixer while it workspass on this  sound quality is decent for the price but reliability gets a zero overall, dead after less than a year ,2
74, this particular brand i've seen around and haven't heard to much about them but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad oneand i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they send another one in exchange that didn't work out so well with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one i'd have to rate this one at the bottom overall, dead digi ,2
75, could be a fluke but my unit was defective straight out of the box  plugged it into the macbook pro fired up garageband and right away it's midi connectivity was intermittent then it had some stuck notes  then it stopped being recognized at all  it still got power from the usb bus but no midi no sound  the jack was visibly wiggly tooso you're mileage may vary but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back  rather than bust it open and get soldering iron i returned it and bought an maudio oxygen 25 for 20 more overall, defective ,2
76, i bought this to use with my keyboard i wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals it doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano which is what i'd always used doesn't have the same feel either nowhere closein my opinion a sustain pedal like the maudio sp2 sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better the only thing i've found the yamaha fc5 sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals overall,  bleh,2
77, did not hold the strings down very well for me i love the feel of it but the spring needs more power overall, did not like ,2
78, dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago and i have used the standard model for some time it seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrumenti used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while i was doing other things before placing it in the guitarlater i wound up trying the humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a dreadnought i took to putting the dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top pressing on the sides to saturate it then rolling it up in a planet waves microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it then unroll the cloth put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks worked greatso i ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same they now ship without the clips company says they've had too many complaints about scratches though i didn't seem to have a problem wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition more importantly there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when i pressed on the sides of the tube it was empty so i sent it back to amazon for a refund no problem getting the refund but i'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finishif you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above that still works great but there's really not enough room for that in the om model so between that and the missing sponge will just try something else overall, broke two days after use ,2
79, in fact i don't think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours one step on the cord and it came apart this purchase is the very reason why i'm looking to buy a wireless system maybe if you're using this to run a pa i would recommend it but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldn't recommend this itembut to be fair i would recommend wireless to any performer you'll end up saving money over the long haul overall, didn't last a day ,2
80, purchased it to use on a 0028 slotted headstock martin and it just didn't fit well for me also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove a string style worked a lot better was a lot easier to attach and remove and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed overall, didn't work for me on a slotted headstock martin ,2
81, great price but unfortunately this product didn't work for me fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i'm happy with the results overall, didn't work for me ,2
82, the wire clipper and winder work ok but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out i've done it successfully for years overall, disappointed ,2
83, as an amateur musician i'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such  i thought this gadget would do the trick but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn't meet my expectations overall, disappointed ,2
84, first time using item and it broke the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke i was really excited to have this and us it now that i transferred all my music sheet to my ipad as soon as i took it off the mic stand the round piece came off would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review but it only kept referring to delivery i do like the product and it did hold my ipad steady even with a leather case on sad overall, disappointment first not so good review ,2
85, i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic which i was pretty happy with  for my strat however these strings did not sound right from the start after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings  i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems and i was right  i put a pair of d'addario xl 95 highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings  i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently  don't let the higher price on these strings entice you go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent longlasting strings overall, displeased ,2
86, i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record the notes don't bend easilyif you think your will cheat the big boys harps youll be dissapointed quicklythese are little more than toys compared to 40 dollar harps they feel cheap but have a decent sound i dont know if they will last but to make harp noises without decent bends  ill use these sparinglyjim overall, do not be fooled these are just little more than toys ,2
87, i have a taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play if the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made overall, does not fit taylor guitar ,2
88, no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included  the only place is on the box after you have received the item  there's no instruction which is fine but in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use iti bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can't because it doesn't come with a mic clip which i have to spend another 510 to get it plus shipping  the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip  but without it i felt cheated overall, does not include mic clip ,2
89, cable crackles when plug in jack is moved gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product overall, does not perform as expected poor quality ,2
90, no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs no success there is no problem with my jack and the phone is in pristine condition  no problems until now there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work but that's about it i registered my amplitude app and followed all of the instructions on the box i tested the irig with an iphone 4 and was able to get it operatingi am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend's iphone 4 but for my purposes with a 3gs it is a brick if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation i will rerate the product overall, does not work with my iphone 3gs ,2
91, i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store  who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag right?  the price was less than ten bucks but unfortunately it doesn't work very well  the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate  it gets you in the ballpark but just barely  strike a note once and it's sharp  play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune  i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better overall, does the trick just barely ,2
92, i don't know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td9 drums and although it does transmit the data the drum map is totally off the respective triggers hihat hihat pedal etc are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc end of it it was just a freaking hassle i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook which doesn't have a midi input but i gave up in the end and went with my desktop pc and its midi interface overall,  bleh,2
93, first behringer pedal i have returned almost no effect provided by pedal i have returned the unit not worth it lousy pedal overall,  bleh,2
94, this system works just okay  try to turn it up and you get bad feedbackmy microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item  i contacted pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from themthey couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one or where i could even buy a replacementvery frustrating overall, don't break your mic ,2
95, it's semisecure on carpeting or hard floor but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand the bottom piece has no way to lock in place and although with the guitar on it it is more stable i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsyi prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall this one? meh not worth the purchase in my opinion booooooooo overall, don't like the wobbly effect ,2
96, i only bought with the idea that a full version of behringer's sequence program came with itneedless to says its a compact version and for you other imacos x users out there????aint worth yer timeyer better off spending your money on vst's au's that will work with osx and cubase or garagebandother than that its another interface i guess as long as you want to use rca plugs to do that withwho the ^ uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter????based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a pcwindows owner i would get itits about the cheapest way to intro yer way in to dawdat interface mainly im talkning to katz who ownnewer macsimacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and keyboard sequencingfor those users yer better off buying a pizza probably overall, dont think yer gona get the software part for free ,2
97, disapointed the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound it sound muffled i will have to replace it soon overall,  bleh,2
98, i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked  they don't play at all like what i was expecting  under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old jazz iii either and they don't play the same if you turn them over  what's up with that?i'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop  let's hope this is just a shortterm fluke overall,  bleh,2
99, if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound then get a boss gt10 guitar multi effects processor and install boss gt10 patches by james limborg search google for boss gt10 patches by james limborg overall,  bleh,2
100, absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock1970's influences  i would probably buy the phase 100 today though as it has 4 different positions to choose from i assume including the original setup as one of themwell i need to correct this  this review was for the old models  the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified  i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chaini will probably get an eh small stone now though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too  sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by nonmusical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough if at all about the soundquality of their products  the capitalists have become too greedy and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live  god help us overall, old circuit was an irreplaceable classic ,3
101, received a new 500w hartke 2x10 bass combo at church tube pre and ss power amp the preamplifier has one 12ax7 it was an eh it went very microphonic after about ten hours playing time after talking to larry hartke decided i got a bad tube he would not send a warranty replacement my suggestion  new stock tubes are probably not tested prior to installation replace all stock tubes with tested tubes from someone like doug's tubes tube depot eurotubes or some other reputable tube vendor i don' t trust ebay tubes and won't spend the hard earned cash on nos replaced with a jj but should have used a tungsol reissue overall,  not bad,3
102, bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488ive been using the mxl990 mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of i still recommend the mic though it is hotter than the 990in its highs but with good compression power amp and eq the result is well worth the money overall, 1st one produced static but sounds good ,3
103, i got this pretty fast i took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone i'm still shaking my head in disbelief that i got this guitar for the price first the 'tuner' issues that i've been reading about replace the strings i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune a set of d'addario 10's cured that straight away or whatever you prefer just change them the tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame it's the cheap strings now technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box the neck angle was so off the a string rattled no matter how high i set the bridge the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle yes i could have sent it back but i suspect i would have gotten another just like it i had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck and the nut never had to do this to the nut on an electric not even on a used guitar the nut slot was cut too deep as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable it required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most i've ever had to use after i got that straight i removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws in my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matterif i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal but as i'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work i'm steadily staring at the 'qc passed' sticker must have been built on a friday afternoon or something nowafter i did this it is sweet i play through a peavey valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my strat w  duncans and dimarzios the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all after adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them  i'd argue that this is as good as any epi i've ever played as far as pups and all so don't hesitate there because i don't really care for epis and i'm in love with it i bought this to sell mainly but now????  the build quality; hmm if you can do guitar work go for it otherwise i'd highly recommend a more expensive model the 299 models are great right out of the box usually overall, 3 stars good value but it needed a lot of work ,3
104, i own three of these and have them attached to the back of my headstocks great idea great concept and great quality only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that i have recently adopted dunlop jazz iii the dunlop maxgrip jazz iiis and my dava jazz picks just won't stay in there without slipping outfor regular sized picks it's a perfect product for smaller sized picks i improvise by using sd card cases  perfect fit for jazz picks overall, 5 stars for normal size picks but 1 star for jazz picks ,3
105, not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze the exps are nice strings they have a nice feel to them along with less string noise and they last my two acoustic  guitars a takamine mini jumbo and a gretsch jumbo both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars i figured i would try these 8020 strings after using phospher bronze only real problem i noticed is the 8020s seem brighter and they ring longer i prefer the warmer tone and since my guitars have alot of boom already i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast i imagine these strings may work in some instances but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars overall,  not bad,3
106, i bought this guitar nearly a year ago it was my first guitar i never cared much for the sound it always sounded out of tune even when it was in tune i eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this squier my skills are slowly improving but i wanted another electric so i sprang for a epiphone les paul yes it's 3x more expensive than the squier bulletstrat  but it sounds 10x betterif you buy a squier i think you need to be prepared to make this a project guitar you'll probably want to replace the tuners pickups bridge etcor just buy a better guitar to begin with at this price point you probably won't find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar overall,  not bad,3
107, i used a felt pick that was made in the 1940s for a long time and it finally disintegrated over time and became unusable i bought a set of mahalo felt picks and while they seem nice they're too stiff to get a clean sound when strumming and i get a raspy harsh tone when picking single stringsi know many people love these felt picks but i've found a set of soft rubber picks here on amazon that give me a tone that's much closer to the sound of my dearly departed vintage felt pick overall, a bit too stiff for my tastes ,3
109, this device is ok it is light weight and folds nicely but it is not especially stable convenient storage is its biggest plus overall, a decent aid to string changing ,3
110, martin makes a variety of good sounding strings and these are toward the light end  the sound is bright but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asmartin msp4150 sp phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings lightmediumthe custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the lightmedium some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics if you strum harder they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent changing the tone for the same reason a bend would if you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant oneon the other hand compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound the brightness can make an instrument sound quite gooddepending on your style these might be a good choice if you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable these might seem more at home  if you are used to martin medium strings but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things you might like these too but when you pick up a guitar with the martin medium strings you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale onei wouldn't say i dislike these and i wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs but as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from martin but it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique overall, a lightweight contender ,3
111, good picks but not a replacement for jazz 3 that i still prefer over this one nice backup in case you run out overall,  not bad,3
112, this tuner requies an excellent ear although there is a green light o indicte a true tuneit is good deal for the money overall, a little difficult to use ,3
113, i love a lot of danelectro products but not really this one i give it 35 because it works as advertisedthe features are good true bypass requires a 9v wall plug and adjustments are goodbut here's my issue the distortion is not 'crunchy' it distorts sure but the sound is not dimensional it has no depth to itthats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres but i play a lot of bluesrock i ended up switching to a vintagetube overdrive by behringernot for me maybe for you overall, a little flat ,3
114, i had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk and since it was off to the side made it tuff to watch the level meters this clampon boom serves the purpose but has a hard time holding the weight of my shure ksm 32 condenser mic i tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it to keep it from sagging very affordable and i found a work around for the weight issue i wouldn't recommend this if you're doing a lot of recording but it is sufficient for my home studio overall, a little flimsy ,3
115, this is not the greatest product they make  but it works quickly and makes the 12 string spread when needed to do so more easily than most overall, a little iffy ,3
116, a little small for my taste very thin but works well and dunlop products have always peased me as a professional musician overall,  not bad,3
117, i was expecting something a little bigger it will do but next time i probably will look for something with a little more stability overall,  not bad,3
118, i wanted to wait till i got another phono preamp before i wrote this review i did get this from amazontc 754 black phono preamplifier switchablei really needed more aux inputs for cd etc but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others i am using a vintage garrard turntable the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp they are tight but do not make good contact and i need to mess with them this problem is gone with the new preamp overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues if you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where it does sound ok other than being a little bright it does do what is supposed to do overall, a little to bright ,3
119, i wanted to experiment with a thin pick i like the action but thinner picks tend to click over the strings and i don't care much for that these are certainly pretty though and the feel is typical fender celluloid smooth and a little slippery might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers celluloid is highly flammable so be aware of that if you smoke i don't overall,  not bad,3
120, what's to say?  it's not a high end capo and for the price i can lose it  like most of the other capos i have owned  it's not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly overall, a reasonably decent capo that you can afford to leave somewhere ,3
121, never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings for the price paid it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired overall i can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at 15 to 20 dollars then sure still it's an ok product overall, a tad bit noisy and cheaply made ,3
122, this selector is very basic but does the job if you need an ab box for simple set ups give this one a try it works for me and i dont see anything wrong with it is simple affordable and functional what else can you ask for? overall,  not bad,3
123, i prefer shar's overture premieres which are the same price  these ones are a little too &34;bright&34; in sound and not deep or resonant enough  also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior  but for which you would be paying 50 a set overall, acceptable ,3
124, i bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag i know it says tenor now that i look at it but since i put soprano gig bag into the amazon search i figured i would be getting only soprano bags anyway it doesn't seem much more then a normal gig bag yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not not sure how well it holds a tenor since i don't have one mine is black not the almost purple the image shows overall,  accident,3
125, very pleased with timely arrival of the package  excited to use it with my new guitar but after only two days of actual use it broke  the plastic tension section just snapped off  very disappointed overall,  not bad,3
126, this does the job but it's fairly thin and not all that well padded  for twice the price you can get a really nice yamaha hard case that is way more than twice as good  the strap that came with it is no great shakes either overall, adequate but minimally padded ,3
127, i've used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars  my thumb nail can't pluck the strings when i damp them with the heel of my hand  these are adequate in the sense that you can strike the strings with them and they stay on  they have a dullish sound compared to my favorite the long gone national clear thumb pick or the current dunlop clear  i like the sound of the ernie ball thin celluloid picks but they aren't strong enough to grip my thumb  the major problem with these is they aren't large  they're like most other brands' medium  my thumbs aren't tom robbins huge but my hands are bigger than average  these picks cut off the circulation in my thumb if i use them for more than fifteen minutes or so  i think i could brighten up the sound by sanding them down but that's a lot of work for something this cheapdon't buy these if you have a large thumb  if you like a less bright sound and some people do and have a medium sized thumb these might work well for you overall, adequate but small and a bit dull ,3
128, this string winder is adequate but not really solid it gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft i had to glue the contacts on this thing since it gives way at times this is just adequate for my use overall, adequate ,3
129, this isn't the best strap but it's affordable and pretty good for a beginner's guitar strap the pick holder on the strap is pretty neat however i don't find myself using it often the guitar strap is not very comfortable but it does the job recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar don't forget to buy strap locks you will need it overall, affordable ,3
130, all 12 of mine broke within a year and the jacks got bent pretty easily so i switched back to the plastic ones which have lasted me over 2 yearshosa cfs606 6 inch right angle fx pedal cable 6 packand they are still going strong overall, all mine broke ,3
131, over the past couple of months i've been replacing guitar straps  this one seemed ideal for an everyday allaround strap  and it would be but the holes are too tight  really a major chore to get over a strap button  i had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap  i've probably bought dozens of straps over the past fortyplus years and i never had this problem until the latest straps i've purchasedso this strap isn't the only one with which i've had an issue  a tightfitting strap isn't in itself a problem except when one needs to take it off  yikes  otherwise this is a nice strap  oh i tried the strap on three guitars just to be sure the first wasn't an anomaly overall,  not bad,3
132, screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use the black covering of the metal is starting to show wear to be expected but i'm sure you'll appreciate hearing that this is not one of those miracle deals where you get something amazing for the money it is what it is and not much more overall, alright for the price ,3
133, a modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists and songs from different yearsthis amp does not have on board song or drum loops like the spider jamif you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time then this isyour ampif you need a practice amp go with the jami have both amps and as far as i am concerned the jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more even if it is based on the spider 3 technology with a jm4 looper as its enginewhile the spider 4 i have the 150 is a nice amp it is very specific to the user needs and isnot that flexiblei do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals as i used the jam for a longtime without and only acquired the express pedal when i ordered the spider 4also be very aware that the line 6 documentation on their amps is very very lacking to put it mildly and there socalled on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation overall,  not bad,3
134, most better quality leather guitar straps are typically 20 or more so in retrospect the low cost of this planet waves black leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag  i bought it anyway hoping that it would be a decent product but unfortunately upon receiving it i was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the itemwhile the strap appears to be 100 leather and isn't a piece of junk it doesn't appear to be of very high quality the leather is thin and soft and i would not be at all surprised if the edges soon begin to curl and the strap begins to wrinkle i don't expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts to hold up well long term if you use this strap you probably want to use some kind of strap locking systemi have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years the leather is thicker and stiffer and has resisted fraying along the edges while the leather has developed some cracks it is still holding up fine and there is no chance that the strap will tear i could be wrong but looking at the planet waves strap i have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as longif you are a casual player this strap is probably fine although strap locks are recommended the leather may start to curl up and deform but the strap certainly isn't going to fail immediately while serviceable more serious players or those with an aggressive style of playing might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap i decided to keep this strap but it is installed on a secondary guitar that i don't play that much overall, an economically priced strap that is an example of  you get what you pay for ,3
135, as the digital realm and the audio realm become one things like these will become increasingly rare you will always find a place that does not keep up with the times thoughthat alone is a good enough reason to keep stuff like this around for now overall, another decent adapter ,3
136, great guitar companies don't always make or sell under their aegis the best strings i love my teles but i can't stand fender strings likewise i love my martin ukulele but trying these strings for the second time i had the same conclusion as i did the first; aquila's are far better aquila's have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound the martins begin to hold their tune sooner  aquila's take a couple of days or more  but the sound is thinner and the feel isn't nearly as friendly the approximately 3 dollar price difference is not for me worth the lesser satisfaction even on my least expensive ukes considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings the higherpriced aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks use the martin's or any cheaper string when you are working on your uke put the stress of repeatedly detuning and retuning on them then switch to aquila's for playing some may like the martins but few won't love the aquila's overall,  not bad,3
137, as far as banjo strings go these are a good bang for the buck or were when i got them d'addario makes a pretty consistant product i've used them on everything over the years although i prefer certain brands for other things strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with these are also amazingly enough still made in the usa as wellif you buy a cheap instrument here do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are they'll be strung with trash if it's a lower end instrument from china even if you're starting out you should tell the difference right away overall, are these the best strings? no are they good for the money? yes ,3
138, it's a cable no frills tangles pretty easy and due to it's design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should overall, average cable ,3
139, i wanted to use these cables for my acousticelectric guitar  they are a little short for that appicaton my fault though  they seem to be built well but i'd say in comparison to other cables i've used for my applicaiton the sound is average  these will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most  if you are a performing musician you would do better to look at higher quality cables for best sound quality and lowest noise overall, average quality ,3
140, let me start by saying that i never even opened these i've given it a 3 star merely out of respect for hohner i have no clue how they play so you'll have to look at other review for that infoi ordered this product based on the fact that the description states includes a deluxe red pro type hard shell case well not from music123 it doesn't when i asked music123 about this they said oh well we provide amazon with our catalogue and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items really???not only did this not come in the red case which i didn't really care about anyway it didn't come in any version of this case style which i was interested in the case that's shown is the case that's sold individually on many sites for 19 so i figured wow what the heck? i'm getting 7 harmonicas that cost 6 a piece if puchased individually and i'm getting a 19 case with them you'd be silly not to bite on that right? well they came in a cheaper nondescript black zipper case not the one with the hohner logo on it save your money and order this through musicians friend it's the same price free shipping and you get the actual item as it's described on their sitein closing it's been a week since i sent this product back to music123 and i still have not received my refund do yourself a favor and avoid them overall, avoid if sold by music123 ,3
141, i had high hopes for this replacing my pedal board but there are a couple of things i don't like about it  it has a button clip on the back which is nonremovable so makes it all but useless if you don't put it on your belt  i don't know about you but wearing something on my belt with two 14 inch cables is quite a feat  add to that possible lines for headphones and an ac adapter and you look like octomanand what possible function does the kidney bean shape make other than making it odd to put down anywhere with the belt clip sticking out  the menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad  the main rotaries on the front have two functions depending whether you are holding another key down to access the second set  this is extremely difficult to do if you need to switch between settings in a live environment  i have had multiple mistakes and frustrationsimho the pod really belongs on a desktop for daw recording  it doesn't have much value on your belt clip  still have my effects rack overall, awkward size and don't like the double function keys ,3
142, as my reviews demonstrate i'm a sucker for a new tuner  peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners i'd even tried one once but decided it wasn't the sort of thing to be carrying around to jams  so when i saw that peterson had introduced a clip on tuner i couldn't help but salivateawkward is a relative term but i don't feel it's a disservice to use it here  the typical clipon tuner has an lcd needle when the needle is dead center the string is tuner  if it's short of center the string is flat  if it's past center the string is sharp  the sc1 has two sets of rings that appear to rotate analogous to what a strobe might look like  a string is in tune when the rings stop rotating  i found that with the way the sound of strings decays it's difficult to get the rings to stop spinning even in the sc1's sustain mode  i've already returned the tuner  otherwise i just realized it would have been a big help to have done a short video of tuning a guitar with the sc1 and with a zoid or intellithe sc1 also boasts a sweetened mode for tuning guitars  however when  i tuned my loungingathome guitar this way i found the needle was dead center on every string on my intelli tuner for those who've read my other reviews my preferred zoid was in the case with my favorite guitarit may well be and others may report that the sc1's feature set make it ideal for other situations  however if you main purpose is to keep a guitar in tune then with the sc1 costing more than three zoidszoid z1000 clipon tuner by sabineor four intellisintelli imt500 clipon chromatic digital tuner for strings i recommend that you consider the zoid or intelli overall, awkward to use overpriced for tuning a guitar ,3
143, sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings overall,  not bad,3
144, these headphones really seem to be built pretty well so it is with some regret that i have to report that i don't like themthe sound reproduction is not flat and it has a distinct bass heaviness that i can't use when recording or mixing  in addition to the bassheavy delivery there seems to be a dip in the upper mids a boost in the low mids and a rolling off of the high end  this just doesn't work for me in the studio  the overall size of the headphones is large and they won't fit well for people with smaller heads  i had some people try them on and they all stated that the earpieces went down too far and didn't fit on their ears properly  i checked to make sure that they were retracted to their smallest size and they werethis is a shame as tascam make some fine products and are a good name  i have owned four da88 recorders many field recorders and three different portable recorders from them all of which have been great i am certainly not saying anything bad about the company but their headphones are just put out there to be lowpriced headphones that are not suited to a professional studioi have used thesony mdr7506 professional large diaphragm headphone [electronics] for decades now and i still recommend them  i have had the same pairs for over 20 years and they are all still going strong barring replacing the ear padding  the sony headphones do not cost a tremendous amount more and they are worth every penny if you are doing studio worki would also recommend theakg k 240 mk ii stereo studio headphonesorakg k 240 semiopen studio headphonesover the tascam reviewed here  the akg perform much better when you are using a headphone amplifier though so that would need to be taken into account overall, bassheavy with dull highs ,3
145, i liked this tuner the look the size the ease of use the quality performance until it died i think what happened is i just left it on too long my problem was that in order to turn the power off you have to hold the power button rather than simply pressing and releasing it since it died that first time it doesn't seem to perform the same i also haven't really paid much attention to it since it died because i sent another similar tuner in for replacement and i got an acoustic guitar that has an onboard tuner and a tuner pedal for electric guitari wouldn't recommend against this product just remember to hold the power button to turn it off overall, battery problems ,3
146, be careful about using capos like this because if you're using a fine guitar it may damage the finish  try it and double check regularly and i wouldn't leave it clamped on the guitar overnight or for weeks on the guitar stand overall, be careful about using capos like this because if you're using a fine guitar ,3
147, i got this yesterday and everything was alright except that two of the three mics worked one was dead i tested all three of them with the same and different cable and made sure that the the onoff switch was on it was first mic i tested of the three and the dead one of the three everything was good except for that one microphone overall,  not bad,3
148, d'addario are the best strings that i have tried i used to use ernie ball super slinky's but found that these last longer the ernie's bend and play well but they tend to  go dull faster not to mention the ernie's start corroding within a week these d'addario strings stay brighter longer i usually change them about every 4 weeks the ernie's only last me a week 2 weeks at the most that can get expensive fast all around the d'addario strings are the strings 4 me retraction when i originally wrote this review i thought they were the best turns out they are in fact way better than ernie ball strings but they are no longer my preference a friend of mine told me about dr strings and they are much better than these d'addarios dr's last three times as long as d'addario the dr's cost a lil more but they are way better for the money addarios are good but i would recommend spending a few dollars more for dr strings overall, best strings available  until i played dr strings,3
149, the u30 is a decent starter's ukulele no matter what color you get but it is not without its flaws the tuners feel cheap but they are functional much better than friction tuners on toy ukuleles the body paint is of good quality and resists scratches with ease but the paint on the fretboard comes off easily unto your fingers the string action is low making it perfect for fast strum patterns even for a soprano ukulele this one has a higher pitched sound with little sustain which is actually quite authentic for those desiring a more hawaiian sound but the tiny sound and low sustain make playing along with other instruments problematic unless using a microphone the worst aspect of this ukulele are the strings it takes forever to stretch them or break them in this means that you must tune your ukulele virtually after every song so beginning ukulele players should remember to get a chromatic tuner chords that use the first fret such as f and a sound distorted for some reason replacing the included strings with aquila strings makes this ukulele much better but the added cost puts it in the price range of what i would consider a true starter's ukulele the lanikai lu11 the included gig bag is almost useless it has absolutely no padding and is very tight in conclusion its low price and distinctive high pitch hawaiian sound make up for its shortcomings i would not recommend this as your only ukulele or even a starter since the problems with first fret chords will train your ear in a wrong way i would recommend the u30 as a backup or disposable ukulele that you can take anywhere without fear of damaging or losing it but for a little more money you can get better overall, better than a plastic toy ukulele but not by much ,3
150, if you can't find a container and add your own sponge then buy thiskeeping a valuable guitar humidified is essentiali think this item should cost three bucks at most and 150 would still yield a healthy profiti made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are betteri use this one for my baritone uke and the bigger ones i made i use in my dreadnaughtsif you make your own just make sure to not let the sponge drip ie wring it out and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood overall, better than nothing ,3
151, the only reason i give 4 stars is because i ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord i ordered both at the same time other than that they are good hot mics overall, very satisfied ,4
152, perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone's pedal board  many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right  having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting  the ditto is great for practice though overall, very small simple ,4
153, i've been using these for about 3 weeks now  they are strong but flexible and don't seem to develop kinks or bending habits if you roll them up the proper wayi've seen and used some better cables but not at this price point  and i've certainly seen quite a few worse  this is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion overall, very solid cables ,4
154, i only had this board for a day after realizing it was a tab too narrow for the pedal setup i wanted to create on it i do have to say though pedaltrain makes rock solid products sure you could probably fashion your own pedalboard but why bother? this thing has a great finish that will make your pedal array look pro overall, very solid little board for minimal pedal setup ,4
155, i discovered this string lubricant many years ago and i concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although i wouldn't call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well  i unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here  i agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but i guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory one cannot complain too much  now that mine has just run dry i'm going to delay a replacement purchase while i try out something new that i've just discovered called the swipe which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals  if this works as well as advertised i may still get fastfret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortablerecommended overall, very useful accessory for string instrumentalists ,4
156, this little guy has help me record with my apogee one voices and amps to prevent airflow shock on diaphragm wanna have excellent recordings? get one overall, very useful ,4
157, every single guitarist that's plays live or even just practices standing up at home has that worry &34;is my guitar gonna cut lose for my strap and fall down to the floor?&34; well there little fellows are a solution they work just fine and i think they are reliable wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger but i mean good price no need to change the guitar's built in strap buttons 100 recommended also i read a review 'bout it not fitting some guy's lp well obviously that depends on the strap but it use these strap locks on my lp standard 1959 vos and they fit just fine use it with a gibson asfbblk strap overall, very very good ,4
158, this quality bag would probably cost more like 35+ at your local music store appears well made has good padding and several pockets for strings picks cable whatever taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell also mentioned by other reviewers not terrible but somehow chemical hope it goes away soon overall, very well padded with several pockets one star off for weird chemical smell ,4
159, i just bought a rickenbacker 4003 that came with schaller strap locks preinstalled  i've used dunlops before but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass so i just bought the schaller buttons  i don't quite like their look as well as the large round dunlops but there's no question about the quality  these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon overall, very wellmade though not quite my favorite design ,4
160, these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well as other reviewers have stated the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effectsi have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay i don't know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the futurei have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass with some eq tinkering i found a good mix of echo i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d4 and thought it would be a good idea again danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay but this is a good deal and was 100 dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp overall,   nice,4
161, good for any beginner but consultation with a teacher if you have one is recommended  for ham fisted persons positioning is not easy; for lossening strings proper bridge resetting and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required  measuring requires a hard ruler with a full 330 milimeters 325 required  bet you don't have one  or a technician's measuring tape and confident measuring skill  measuring is best with a cooperative assistant  bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the d string to hold the bridge position measurement check tightening the a string measurement check removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the 1st and 4th strings and tuning the instrument do it  you'll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing  if you ain't intelligent good luck  you'd best be served with dot stickers overall,   nice,4
162, the rosin does the trick and it's cased in a nice wooden holder so it shouldn't crack easily unlike those round rosin containers overall,   nice,4
163, i purchased a 3 pack of the soft rubber wedgie's as an addon to a larger order as such i found them to be a reasonable value however i'm not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic i think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or uke they are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comforti love the very soft warm sound they provide i use them mostly late at night when i can't sleep and want to play but the rest of the family is still sleeping not quite as effective on the e a and d steel strings but certainly playable not so great for strumming but fun to pick individual chords thanksspo overall, warm soft tone similar to a felt pick ,4
164, i recently picked up the tc electronic mojomojo overdrive at a steal of a price but i'm evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price  i own many different overdrives including light overdrives in the tubescreamer and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous blues driver ocd joyo ultimate drive etc  to me this is closer to the tubescreamer family as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive  actually the separate knobs for bass and treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the digitech bad monkeybuild quality  outstanding  it has an mxr style click button press but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last  the 9v jack is on the top out of the way of the io jacks  the battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screwbutton that you can easily get open with your fingers or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver  the thing is dense and build solid as a rock  i always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crushresistant and tend to get punted around by your cables  finally the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback and several of them are actually notched to settle into the 12 position which is a nice touchtone quality  obviously the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review  i would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a 5 and absolutely loved it as several previous reviewers did  but based on the pedals i have used and my experiences with the mojomojo it feels more like a 4 to me  the tone is very warm almost to the point of being muddy  whether the mod switch is a boost or a cut the pedal is bassier in the up position  don't get me wrong i definitely appreciate the abundance of lowend frequencies but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through  i could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments  it does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character  however if you'd like a similar effect with a much more expressive and brighter output try the mad professor sweet honey overdrive or its clone companion the joyo sweet baby overdriveease of useversatility  many overdrives only have the single tone control so i was excited to see controls for bass and treble  still i feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps and very muddy with others  i will update my review if my feelings change as i have a few different combinations i want to try out  i feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion  this is much the way you would use a tubescreamer  i will say that it is one of the more tubelike overdrives i have tried  hit the notes lightly and you get a clean transparent tone  attack them harder and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup much like a tube amp  however if your hope is simply to plug into the mojomojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal overall, warm tubelike overdrivebooster with voicing you may or may not like ,4
165, the adjustment screwhandle bit still works after 2 years and the base is heavy a cast metalthey look good and the paint lasts great for a performance spacenow about the title i used one i own 2 as a sledge hammer during a band bonding event the base ended up striking the concrete patio and a chunk of the base broke off not a issue with manufacturer but don't drop it too hard despite the break the stand still sits upright and i still use itnice and cheap overall, warning do not use as weapon ,4
166, it looks nice it's really really long and it's made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip after throwing it into the washing machine 3x with lots of softener rubbing it with lard dirt and baby powder then soaking it over night it's finally soft and i could play naked without slicing off my head  so buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up overall, wash it rub it lube it wash it soften it ,4
167, nice cushion on both sides  onstring and the back of the arm stays very firm on the arm it'll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playingthe 4star is just to alert that it may be a problem for people with not so strong hands like kids  as the spring is very tough overall, well built but requires some strong hands ,4
168, these cables are nicely constructed i bought them for home use only home recording or just practicingthey seem to work well so far i wouldnt gig with these on a regular basis but for home use with littleabuse they should last overall, well made cables for general use ,4
169, stripped down one of my basses at the weekend found this very useful made stripping and replacing strings really easy large enough to fit the fender tuners have 2 new sets of strings on order so fitting them won't be as daunting a task as without this item overall, well made unit ,4
170, well made capo works as designed on my acoustic easy to usel and it is nice that you can adjust the pressure on the strings just wish it had a spring so it could stay attached to the head of the guitar when not in use i am always setting it down and forgetting where i left it overall, well made ,4
171, there's no substitute for the right part these are great  i like having extras around just in case i rescue another orphaned guitar to rebuild  the springs are almost always missing cost less here than at guitar center so badabing overall, well they're springy ,4
172, i'm primarily a guitarist but i keep an inexpensive sx bass around for when i'm selfrecording and whatnot  since it isn't my primary instrument and i don't play bass live well not yet it never made sense to invest in a bass amp  i bought this to liven up the tone when recording in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface  it does the job; makes the sound warmer and more amplikehonestly if you've been doing some homework about this thing you should know what to think of it  behringer's build quality can be dubious sometimes but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isn't a picky audiophile  this box is no exception  i've never personally played through a sansamp but i would hazard a guess that if you know that's what you want this won't satisfy you  if you want something like a sansamp you could do a lot worse than venture the 30some bucks on this little boxto my ears it sounds quite good  get it if it fills a need for you and you're broke  knocked off a star for behringer's usual build quality although mine hasn't broken from gentle use yet overall,   nice,4
173, works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made but other than that works as intended overall,   nice,4
174, hard to review picksbut these are as advertisedhavent used enough to see if images wear wellor just disappear from usebut they are what they areenjoy overall,   nice,4
175, they are comfortable to use  the planet wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick; and i like heavy picks so the heavy option fits my preference  i've got a gig tomorrow night so we'll see how they work then overall,   nice,4
176, i retubed my carvin x60 combo with a duet of mullards and 3 of these eh preamp tubes wow  they all come to life and make the amp sizzle the price was right from amazing overall,   nice,4
177, its a one dollar pice of plastic that holds your picks it has a spring in it that pushes them up like a dispenser in a way has sticky stuff on the back so you can stick it to your guitar or case so you always have picks overall,   nice,4
178, i really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky very obvious calls a lot of attention to itself all giant and redstill i can't fault it's tuning prowess it's quick and pretty on the money it replaced my roland boss tu12hwell more handy for tuning my sweet la patrie nylon strung &34;motif&34;would buy again  but i'd really prefer a more subdued  color overall,   nice,4
179, first of all don't be oversold by the extraordinary value that some reviewers claim this fiftybuck inputting device to be  akai is considered a budgetpriced version of and a step down from sony which in the minds of some has dropped a few steps lower itself  but it's the ideal solution for many of us who may be working at a desktop computer with garageband bandinthebox finale sibelius audacity or a similar program  the last thing i would do is lug a 50pound pc or sp kurzweil model plus ac power transformer upstairs to place on an overcrowded desk even the 12pound yamaha np30 with its 76 notes is awkward to use for this purpose  make it nothing longer than a 41note keyboard but if you can get one at half the price of the emusic 41note that may be the handiest most practical device for your needssure there are alternatives  you can click at a virtual keyboard that garageband makes available for a mousebut it's slow  or you can download a virtual keyboard to your ipad or ipod for a couple of bucks but it's limited to no more than an octave and a touch screen which though superior to mouseclicking still isn't as satisfying or immediate as inputting by pressing down on actual physical keysthis cheaplymadeeven cheapbut effective akai keyboard fits the bill very nicely especially for someone who's working in congested space  it's regrettable the company refers to it as a performance keyboard  it's nothing of the sort nor should it be  that's the reason i initially went with the np30 only to find that the bipurpose instrument i had in mind was impractical for either intended usetake a look at the korg nano piano and if you're a pianist you'll immediately see the superiority of the akai  but be careful not to be lulled into purchasing the deluxe model of either the akai or the emusic or you'll be close to spending as much as you would for a keyboard that lives up to the name performance  this akai model looks and feels like a kindergartner's tendollar toy but it's the best compromise i've been able to turn up for my crowded work area overall, when tiny and cheap is better than big and expensive ,4
180, bought this for my guitar pedals and it works great and doesn't cost much  i just attached it to an existing adapter and voila overall, when you need it this comes handy ,4
181, works for my behringer xm1800s mics it came with a smaller thread adapter on it already idk what mics use that but is something to note overall,   nice,4
182, this behringer unit has all the necessary features to give you solid performance in a stompbox delay pedal  i say why pay more? overall,  nice,4
183, when i bought these i was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording  once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks  the device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it  the filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where i wanted it and to keep it thereon the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use overall, will give you better recordings but can be a pain ,4
184,pretty good I enjoyed them, nice,4
185, nice quality and love the cutter the winder is a little awkward to use i guess i need a little practice but the cutters are great overall, winder is a little tricky and takes some practice ,4
186, works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my mxl v67g; which is all i needed it for overall,  nice,4
187, a friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and i loved having an onoff switch right at my fingertips geniusi bought 2 immediately the shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or earstwo issues to consider the right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my tele and my takamine it would not seat properly and would slide out i had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side where it worked but now the switch is &34;down there&34; i don't think planet waves is the first connector that i had a problem with that so i dont blame them but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure second issue is simply that these little buttonswitches are fussy you have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them  feel wont do if you see the white edge they are &34;quiet&34; overall,  nice,4
188, yes if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work finei did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitarsbut its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problemi tried not to drill on most of my guitars  some fit without drilling some did notgood luckgood price welll made overall, work fine kinda protruding ,4
189, i like these straplocks but they were a little tight to get on a levy's strap  i did manage to get it on  however i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar overall, work fine  tight fit with some straps ,4
190, i got these for noise reduction barking dogs loud trucks etc they work well for that the only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head after a time the pinch is bit much i have a small 714 hat size too however the price was great and the sound is good i'm no audiophile but do play guitar mando and dulcimer and for me these phones deliver a good well rounded soundone other thing these headphones are made for the studio not for outdoor useso if you can deal with the pinch i highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality overall, work well but pinch ,4
192, although i never gigged with it i think this would be great for any musician who gigs with a 2x12 or a 2x10 combo amp i used this with various fender and line 6 amps and it worked great for amplifying the sound would buy again if given the circumstance overall, worked great ,4
193, i plugged in the amp and i plugged in the bass and there were no issues with the wire  this is one of those products you don't want to overly notice and in that it has done the job is is designed for overall, working cord ,4
194, it works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my makeshift panty hose pop filter what else is there to say? overall,   nice,4
195, works well for acoustics as well as electrics  i have amazon prime so i got it quick well made and folds easily overall, works as advertised at a good price ,4
196, nothing special here if you don't like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap and you don't want to bore a hole in the heel then this is a nice compromise there are slits on both ends of the leather which means you can reverse the button if you don't want the logo on the front of the guitar neckheadstock you could even flip it insideout and have the soft leather side exposed i subtracted a star because i think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic overall,   nice,4
197, when you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply  there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psusbotherwise the time machine works fine as described overall,   nice,4
198, the capo looks nice and works without any problem  you can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff  but the build is solid and it looks like it will last for a long time overall,   nice,4
199, i've had this for about 2 weeks now and this capo is simple and works great it feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well if you know how much pressure to apply to the frets the capo works great though i always have to do a bit of fine tuning as was expected in the first place i love how cheap it was compared to the other capos and yes it's not made of plastic overall, works as good as any other capo for a lower price ,4
200, the one i got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw i feel like if i tighten it too much i could dent my mic stand tube but i haven't dented anything yet so perhaps i'm just too skeptical in any event it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction but everything works it's getting the job done and i haven't seen a better option all in all a pretty good device overall, works as intended ,4
201, comparisons  i have compared side by side the following pedals fulltone mini deja vibe 200 dunlop univibe discontinued stainless steel model220 dunlop rotovibe 180 voodoo labs micro vibe 150 bbe soul bender 129 as well as comparing to some different beasts in the modulation family  an mxr phase 90 mxr evh flanger boss chorus behringer vibrato and behringer time machinesummary  just the factsa great pedal and my favorite univibe of all doesn't take a lot of space up standard power supply good visibility on control knob settings does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise this is the only pedal in the univibe group i can say that about and it's why it's almost certainly going to be the one i keep might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others  still need to play with it a little more overall i love this pedal at under 60 bucks only downsides i see are the led does not flash the speed rate and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to toe tweak with my right foot quality seems ok but time will tell on durabilitypros smallish form factor although slightly larger than a boss pedal doesn't take much more room than a standard pedal standard power supply 9v center negative and jack on top back for easy access  not in the way for patch cables on sides switchable between chorusunivibe and vibrato controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking  easy to see best pro is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass mids or lows it just applies the univibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone this is the only pedal i tested that i can say that about  and most of the others cost 24 times what this one cost led is red visible and not a weird bright laser to my retina the price at about 60 bucks  is a great deal quality of construction  metal case decent knobs pots and switches  no complaints so farcons led does not flash speed rate speed control would be better placed top right or bottom right for toe tweaking i have just had this a day so can't tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound  not sure about that and i will update this review as i get time to test further but it sounds great to meoverall  highly recommended if you want a univibe and don't want to do a lot of comparison shopping i have done it for you some users report quality issues here  i guess time will tell on that mine works fine so far and for 60 you could buy 2 and still save money over most other options availablenotes on ***other*** pedals i compared fulltone mini deja vibe  highest quality construction as expected at 200 the large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking  very useful on a vibe pedal my complaint is that this vibe colors my tone  it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass this probably helps the sound stand out in a mix however i'd rather that my vibe not provide eq because when i switch it on or off i don't want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back my sound i was able to match exactly an authentic original univibe sound with some adjusting it seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also i have a lovehate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it some days i hate itbut i like the build quality and the speed control i originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn't strip the treble off my tone  until i realized the mids were boosted the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked mixed bag and at 200 shouldn't be mxrdunlop m68 new in 2014 at about 140 the new m68 univibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like it is second place on my list on pure sound i might even like it slightly better than the jimi and that's saying something it's the perfect form factor shapesize with no significant coloration of the tone other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode the m68 gives the jimi a good runand if you are extremely tight on board space it might be a better choice for you they sound very similar the m68 has a wider range of adjustment on speeddepth than the jimi but i'm not sure the extra range is useful mxrjim dunlopmxr have great factory customer service if you ever have an issue they fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty i really do wish mxr would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface it is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other mxr's use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as i'd have to leave it with the mini switch engaged and the red led burning all the time looking like it is on when i was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch it was also a tight fit this pedal has a level knob which i'm usually a fan of but i don't see the need for it on this effect i didn't care for the white main led much and of course the power supply location the led on this does pulse the speed but was annoying due to the white led that's a subjective thing i suppose all said this is a great sounding option with that perfect mxr size so a good choice but still 2x the cost of the jimi i stuck with the jimi on form function sound and value dunlop univibe uv1  cool stainless steel construction knobs were hard to see settings placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick sound was very good but did also color my eq sound by boosting the bass and muffling the mids and highs slightly on the one hand this sound matched a lot of recorded univibe sounds i've heard on the other hand once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix the seller had a 3 day return policy 3 days?? so i returned it and they lost the sale othewise i would still be thinking about this one i was on the fence about whether it was my winner i was able to match a true univibe sample but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me at 220 i'd have to love it to keep it voodoo labs micro vibe  liked the form factor the simple controls high visibility knobs ability to toe tweak controls standard 9v power supply and placement of all jacks can get a very lush even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted and midshighs are cut the eq effect just kills the pedal for me its going back not my pick at 150 bbe soul bender  my least favorite vibe it had extreme muffling of mids and highs heavy boost of bass in a band mix i'm pretty sure it would get totally lost at home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple i think it pulsed the speed my recollection is it had an overly bright blue led it was the first vibe i bought and i only compared to fulltone and dunlop before returning it had some useable sounds but with the intensity above 50 had an annoying womp womp womp of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar  a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion with intensity below 50 it was usablekind of but a tone muffler i returned this one early dunlop rotovibe , a great choice for a univibe pedal ,5
202, first off; let me start by saying i bought this guitar because it was only 100 and i was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before i return homei did not expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitari did want something cheap i could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashedwhen i unboxed this guitar i was floored the hardware is much higher quality than i had expected by far the strings it came with weren't complete crap but i swapped them out for my favorite set of strings, absolutly an amazing guitar for 100 ,5
203, i'll echo what others have said  this is a superbly built instrument for the price and i don't know how epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively it looks feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as mucha few notes  what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the &34;vintage&34; model is actually a superrich deep deep mahoganymaroon color and it's unbelievably beautifulas others have said the factorysupplied strings are crap; if you judge the instrument by them you'll be disappointed include a set of aqila nylgut strings when you order this ukulele and restring it as soon as you get iti was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my 60 kala soprano ukenormally one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder fuller sound but the les paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an allacoustic ukulele and that probably accounts for the quieter tone i think it's a *better* tone and i'm more interested in delicacy than in loudness so i'm happy with it if i wanted stadiumfilling volume i could always plug this into a stack of marshall ampsoh i almost forgot one important note to all owners, an exceptional value and you can get rid of the pick guard ,5
204, these cables have been solid; we use them in the studio every single day and have held up so well compared to many others i've ordered for lessyes 70 on cables seems like a boring way to spend that money but don't be fooled  nothing makes you looks stupider during a recording session than a blown cable not only do these hold up and sound great i've found that when working with a complicated studio setup i'm always surprised how helpful the colorcoding actually ends up being for the price this is totally worth iti use these with the following to really color code my studio setup color windscreens b003vybnhgdefinitely worth it makes a huge difference overall, definitely worth the price helpful for complex recording setups ,5
205, to describe my impressions of the th2000s versus my wellused sennheiser hd201s i chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values   i like to use recordings i know well so i can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarityandres segovia  `variations on a spanish folk tune  narvaez' from `my favorite spanish encores'in my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar i've ever heard both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound  the distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that segovia's arrangement of the original vihuelatexture really emphasize for me there's a difference between bass presence and bass clarity i'll gladly trade less `oomph' in the gut for the kind of definition the tascam's bring out, feel and sound like the real deal ,5
206, i purchased this when it was on sale during the christmas season  i figured that for the asking price at the time i could not go wrongmy expectations were frankly low i had heard nothing but horrible things about epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability what i received was the polar opposite  i received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when i unboxed iti am not wild about the strings that came stock but i am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums i guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads in the near future i intend to restring the guitar withd'addario ecg25 chromes flat wound electric guitar strings light 1252 which while thick should make the instrument jazzfriendly i realize that flatwound strings will require a new setup and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investmentout of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed i have already invested in a good  but not great case guardian hardshell electric guitar caseto store the guitar i also uploaded a customerprovided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fitsfor the record i use the following amp which i have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar, five stars for value and playability ,5
207, summaryat 20 it is a great size and ok quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside no padding or impact resistance is provided but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle also available 8 longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different modelspros  good size for speaker stands mic stands guitar stands music stands other than the top shelf and other whatnot you may want to cram in there depending on your style affordable at 20 availalbe on prime shippingcons  this model is one compartment for speaker stands you may want a 2 compartment model lack of any impact resistance  the bag has no padding at all it is just canvas it would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to acco, good bag for the price here's what it holds,5
208, pros i bought this pedal primarily in place of a volume pedal or swell pedal because it does that function fairly well and a lot cheaper aside from that it also does nearly every other type of delay needed *the tapedigitalanalog switch slightly changes the sound of each delay*the trails feature can be useful for holding a sound in swell mode with high repeats when the pedal is &34;off&34; and then playing over it with notes or harmony*the time knob acts like an analog knob pitch shifting when turned after playing a note*the repeats knob can go from a little more than one repeat to self oscillation sometimes runaway depending on the delay type*the mix knob can nearly cut out the dry signal*stereo input allows for multiple instruments to play into itwhile the pedal has small problems it compensates by inexpensive fixescons, good deal good pedal comprehensive review ,5
209, pros  works really well and is easy to use the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too it is amazing how you can add layers upon layers without any loss of qualitycons, great pedal ,5
211, having to send the first snark sn8 back but the replacement thus far has been flawlessi made a slight adjustment to my guitar's truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot ona couple tips to tuning a guitar  tune it like you play it if you strum & play softly then pluck & tune each string softlyhowever most people don't play softly so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes  they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out & so they are generally tuning each string as it begins softly resonatingso in essence what happens is people are generally tuning each string flatto tune your guitar correctly you really ought to pluck each string hard like every 2 seconds and tune it that way  rather than waiting for the sound to fade out if you do it this way you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you're strumming the living daylight out of italso please check your intonation your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings you pluck your open string hard & tune as described above then you check intonation by pressing very lightly with just the tip of your finger and don't touch any other part of the neck on the same string but 12th fret  and both should be in tune the exact sameif they are off 12th & open then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment please don't pay someone to setup your guitar you can do it yourself so easily go on u toob and search scott grove tuning your guitar wrong and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3000 guitars  & he spends almost an hour explaining all the details also watch his video on how to setup, love my sn8 ,5
212, the exh hot tubes compact pedal offers a very unique sound and is difficult to review from an objective standpoint  i had no knowledge of or experience with the original fullsized hot tubes pedal from the late 1970's  and frankly many of the reviews i read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering  i think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier  really though if you think about it doesn't every overdrive pedal including the venerable tubescreamer make that same claim?when i plugged into the hot tubes i was surprised but immediately intrigued  i actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent east river drive which was very good but also a very &34;familiar&34; sounding clone of a ts808  what the hot tubes does is anything but &34;familiar&34; from an affordable od pedalthis pedal has a significant amount of output and unlike many other overdrives it has considerable low end  in fact it likely even adds bass to your sound  there is a tone circuit bypass switch that i do not fully understand  basically with the switch off there is no tone control and they advertise this sound as &34;powerful&34; and touchresponsive since the pedal trends to the darker side of things however i actually left it in the &34;on&34; position and worked the tone from the 1200 to 130 settingsthe gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp  from the 7 00 on the overdrive knob the amount of gain increases exponentially  at this point the pedal behaves more like an overdrive though the gain is almost fuzzlike  some people have described it as a &34;jack white&34; type of sound but i'll really leave it to individual users to decide if they &34;like&34; it or notthere are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about  first i want to make clear that this is a dark bassy pedal  in that respect it is completely different from the exh soul food and east river drive both of which have some measure of bass drop  the tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit but it could do more  i do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with  it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking into it  if your rig is already on the dark or muffled side you may want to stay away from this pedal  that being said i would definitely recommend &34;try before buy&34; with this one because it is different in hardtodescribe waysfor now my rating is 5 stars  solid ehx construction very compact accessible 9v jack on the top where it i like it and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesn't sound at all like the other overdrives i have  it certainly won't be for everybody but so far i like what i hear overall, reissued vintage circuit somehow stands out as unique overdrive ,5
213, disclaimers 1 obtained free as part of amazon's vine program2 tested on 4 ukuleles and one guitarso ukulele players  yes this tuner is for youi tested this diminutive tuner on, small & accurate ,5
214, i am  primarily an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago a gibson les paul what i am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars most namebrand strings are just fine but some are markedly different than others a few are actually a notchabove the others these nyxls from d'addario are definitely in that 'notch above' categoryi find them easier to play better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others i have tried i plan to stick with them  a few comments about each area playability these nyxls bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting left hand than do most of the others of course i have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent  but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore these strings seem less 'cutting' even after a couple of hours of constant playing they also 'squeak' less when i slide up and down the necksound, the best i have ever used these really are different and better ,5
215, for those unfamiliar with vox's amplug products these things are amazing  i'm just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990's and they were mostly terrible  what vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers which weigh virtually nothing run for 1015 hours on 2 aaa batteries and plug directly into the guitar is nothing short of amazing  they have incredible amplike tone and get as loud as you can possibly want  even through a pair of 20 sony headphones they sound amazing  the star of the collection in my opinion is the vox ac30 amplug which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to top boost overdrive  if you haven't played an amplug before the ac30 one is 3999 of the best money you'll ever spendnow getting to this specific joe satriani amplug it's impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself  fans of joe satriani even casual ones will recognize elements of this sound right away  satriani has a very distinctive sound which he crafted over the years using a modified boss ds1 distortion and more recently his vox satchurator distortion box  it's a thick lead tone with a nice sustain and colored with a delay effect  both of those elements are present on this signature amplug  you have a level control a gain control and a tone control  there's also three switch positions  off on and fx  the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the samepros first the price retails at 4999 whereas most of the other models are 3999  i believe the lead amplug is also 4999 and also has a delay feature  i think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money but this is admittedly a sort of niche product  overall however you have several amplugs to choose from and if you choose this one 4999 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone  the tone has a real sweet spot between 3 and 5 that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes  while it isn't necessarily and ideal rhythm guitar distortion you can hit rich chords with nice sustain  i prefer the tone on the higher gain levels and you can really crank it up if you want to but it sounds great at lower volumes too  the delay is also surprisingly good  it's probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap which is pretty standard  adds a cool echo fullness to your solo progressions much like a classic satriani solo  again the overall tone is fantastic  with the amount of gain provided you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit though i've always thought of satch of more a technical melodic guitarist than a metal guitaristcons  in addition to the aux jack which allows you to plug in an mp3 player and jam along it is possible to use a 18 to 14 adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp pa or anything with speakers  you might be surprised how good it soundsas an afternote i wrote most of this review playing on my jackson dr6 which has two seymour duncan humbuckers and it sounded great  i later tried it on a gibson les paul which is usually my primary guitar and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers it did not sound as good  the distortion was much more fizzy  haven't tried it with single coil pickups but i think that it would likely work well with a strattype guitar due to the overall roundness of the tonethe amplug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing irrespective of their budget or living situation  the satriani model brings its own special character to the series and if you like the tone as much as i do might become an instant favorite overall, thick satriani lead tones onthego ,5
216, i am suing this item on a regular basis to tune my guitar and it seems to work fine no complains overall,  nice,5
217, i just recently started up learning guitarthis tuner has already paid for itself in checking that my guitar is in tunegreat device overall,  nice,5
218, this tuner works great easy to attach turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string is as easy as one two three overall,  nice,5
219, this is a very quite tube and has all the gain you'd expect from a great 12ax7 tube if your looking to push a power tube into distortion this little bugger will definately do the trick overall,  nice,5
220, this little dude does a great job the clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries i highly recommend i can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine overall, turn on your love light ,5
221, simply put this speaker turned my super champ xd into a killer 15watt amp gave the amp more lowend and made everything much clearer i would and do recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their super champ sound and like other people have said the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting i had to turn the amp down two notches two number to have the same volume level out of the ampif my super champ was stolen i'd buy a new one and put this speaker in it wouldn't even think twice about it overall, turned my super champ xd into a new amp ,5
222, i bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar the difference is quite noticeable and good the guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a better than a lot more expensive guitars sound i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements in my estimation the sound is clearer brighter and louder the price seemed high for a little chunk of plastic but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied overall, tusq saddle improved sound quality ,5
223, looks really cool and sounds great  no buzz or unwanted noise with these cables and they have a velcro strap which makes it easy to store them when you are done  i like them a lot overall,  nice,5
224, this is a great deal for two microphone stands  they are well constructed and are very flexible; can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand  several adjustment areas allow the perfect heightpositioning  these should last a long time as long as they're not abused overall,  nice,5
225, i didn't know when i ordered these mic stands that they were on stage stands they are fully adjustable great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics excellent quality i'm very happy with this set overall, two great mic stands + one low price = great value ,5
226, these are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion they play extremely well and last a long time there's nothing better than these strings overall, two words the best ,5
227, i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine it hasn't seen heavy use it wasn't supposed to it sits in a corner of the living room holds the guitar securely and doesn't cause problems although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious and my 91 yo neighbor was convinced for a year that i was drunk and  wailing away on the guitar at 3 am at least that's what she told the policethis stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musician's gear stand they might actually be the same stand under different names the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping if i were to buy a stand again i would still get this one because it's available under prime the other one isn't that gives this stand more valuethe stand is very easy to set up the lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar this took a little getting used to but it does work very well the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problemsgiven the very low price this is an excellent choice for a living room stand if you're on the road or performing you might need something a bit different but i can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself overall, two years old and still going strong ,5
228, nice basic guitar strap great price and should last long enough  i have started using the padded levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap this can be a little scratchy overall,  nice,5
229, the planet waves guitar rest works for ukuleles  i just got one and have used it for a few days and it's the bomb  i can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over  this product is a rubber disc with small arms in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface and you can set your instrument against it and voila it doesn't fall over  here at home i use it on the second shelf of a bookcase and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove heel on carpet neck in guitar resti'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases because i can use them at one of my uke parties  if one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor for instance to take a whizz they're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them  here i just find a spot near wherever i'm sitting and it becomes my lean spot and i can even set my beer can on the round part on the back  coaster ukeguitar holder  it's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument  i could carry a metal stand with me but it wouldn't fit in my ukulele casethis planet waves product does  a winner overall,  nice,5
230, i used these on my ukuleles and they worked well enough that i bought tow more pairs  they hold a regular strap well and work particularly well with the leather strap attachment from a uke leash google it those are fabulouscheers overall,  nice,5
231, i payed the 11 for this just because the tuner i have was so slow to respond i needed something new  the response time on this is like half a second and it's super simple to use  keep in mind that the snark website sells this tuner for 40 so 14 the cost here is definitely worth it overall, unbeatable deal ,5
232, this gauge is perfect for my 1970 gibson j50 the phospherbronze alloy wrap brings out hidden tonal snap in this old rather heavilybraced guitar the may be too bright for a lighter instrument but they really shine on my old guitar overall, unbeatable for an older guitar ,5
233, until 56 years ago there was a virtual void in highquality personal digital recorders  then the zoom h2 came along and numerous variations on a theme were soon to follow  i've owned both the h2 and the h1 and though both have their strong points the tascam dr05 has served me better than either the h2 has pleasing 4point sound and the h1 at half the size of the tascam works well for stealth as well as video recordings when mounted on a camera  but both recorders are more complicated than necessary with tricky menu systems excessive tiny buttons 6 on one thin side of the h1 and dicey build qualitythe tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine that's a pleasure to use  there are no shaky rattling parts the controls are solid and instantly solved easily manageable with a single thumb and the widespread mic pattern is ideal for most stereo recordings of music for dictation i use a separate small mic inserted in the topside input  the machine reminds me of the far costlier sony pcm50 in terms of ease and convenience of operation the tascam's 320 kbps mp3 recordings of a grand piano strike my ears as no less authentic and sonically present than its 9624 wav files and tweaking is held to the absolute minimum  if you don't have 500 to spend and are looking for a woodshedding companion for dayin dayout use this is the one overall, unbeatable value convenience and durability ,5
234, wow simply good for the price u can not get a better deal it does the job perfectly i have 4 of these so far will get more if needed overall, unbeatable ,5
235, this microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received it is very well made equipment which is readily apparent to a total sound equipment novice like myself the item as pictured looks different from what i received; it is not the all lighter gray plastic looking body base it's more of champagne color and is metal and the screw on adapter on the bottom is black heavy duty plastic not sure why the picture is showing that is because the actual microphone i received is much more impressive lookingi was initially looking to spend ~125 on a simple home recording setup using my imac i ultimately spent about 135 because i moved to a behringer mixer board that can convey the appropriate power to a condenser mic like this onefor those who are starting out with recording i recommend this microphone and a quality xlr cord and you will not be disappointed with your results overall, unbelievable quality for the price ,5
236, at the 600 price point for an all tube amp plus reverb and tremelo well there are two pedals i won't have to buy this is insane it is not only really loud but you can do anything from jangly pop to pink floyd to hard rock high gain modern metal heads though might want to look at engl i dialed in a richie blackmore tone the other day and just started blasting awayit's also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained usethe only thing that was a drag about it was that the footswitch which controls the reverb and tremolo is sold separately at about 40 street and everybody was out i managed to snag one but it involved a bit of luck they should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks overall, unbelievable value for money ,5
237, this is an amazing guitar i couldn't put it down i have experience playing really really expensive guitars my 500 beater acoustic i was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all i couldn't imagine what i would b getting for 90 by was i wrong it's my best acoustic currently this thing sounds like sustains and holds its' own tune like a similar 200000+ martin model and that's zero exaggeration get it and see you will be blown away i bought a second one i just wish i had found this guitar sooner overall, unbelievable ,5
238, highest quality guitar i've ever seen in this price range it looks feels and sounds amazing a+ i bought two overall, unbelievable ,5
239, got it for 500 bucks and wish i'd bought about 5 more just as good as anything else out thereonlky complaint is the adjustment to the neck support does go as low as i'd like but that's my take on it buy if you need a stand for the money you won't be disappointed overall, unbelievable ,5
240, i have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one  however it seems the have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint  they have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included  this bracket holds the ns micro tuner of which i have 3  i had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications  however now this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need  a simple modification but bordering on genius  the capo itself id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed  highly recommended overall,  nice,5
241, as stated i use the d'addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for the gibson lp's and i use brite wires on thosei like the d'addario's over the brite wires because they have color coded balls and this makes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier do not produce a lot of body acid so strings last a very long time with me no matter who the manufacturer is and i play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyset exl strings produce great tone and are great for bending overall,  nice,5
242, i bought these for my teen son who plays the bass he absolutely loves them and they seem to be lasting a good while as well nice sounds overall, use for bass guitar very pleased ,5
243, sometimes i have to run a longer cable to a snake if i'm doing the big band thing otherwise i use this cable at every show love it overall,  nice,5
244, a real workhorse for sure  not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars  i also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big  almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it overall,  nice,5
245, a lot of zoom h1 users put this over their mics  the fit is nearly perfect  for that application this is the windscreen to get  works great overall,  nice,5
246, these are great  i have these on all my guitars  only problem is the clip on install to the strap  if you can't get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place  once installed you are good for life overall,  nice,5
247, 2 15&34; speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet these hold up great year round i will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don't fall onto my baby grand overall,  nice,5
248, i use this all the time  it's pretty basic but really good for a beginner  not all chords are in here but the &34;core&34; chords are  worth the price overall,  nice,5
