<h1> Sentiment Analysis in C </h1>
Author: Taylor McNeil

This program was a bonus project for my System Level Programming Class. The purpose was to perform sentiment analysis on a set of Amazon reviews. I chose to use Naive Bayes as my classifier to determine whether or not a review was positive or negative. My algorithm was not perfect for this; therefore I ended up using the rating as the final determinate if the Native Bayes produced a strange number.
